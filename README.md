## Overview
This application fetches and processes data from various sources to generate statistics and insights. The data is then stored in BigQuery for further analysis. Uses this data to create a ["Dataprodukt"](https://docs.knada.io/dataprodukter/dataprodukt/).


Runs as a [Naisjob](https://doc.nais.io/explanation/workloads/job/?h=job) on a schedule set in `.nais/nais.yaml`.

Ensure that the required environment variables are set (found in nais console) :
* GCP_TEAM_PROJECT_ID
* NAIS_ANALYSE_PROJECT_ID
* GITHUB_TOKEN
* NAIS_API_TOKEN
